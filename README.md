# WikiRythm

## WikiRythm

- Our motivation in building a WikiRythm page is to get better at JavaScripting/API's/HTML and CSS.
- We built this WikiRythm to be able to search for an artist, their latest releases and see what they look like.
- We learned how to work on a project as a group.

## User Story
```
As a user…
I want to… be able to search for an artist on on a webpage, and get information about their latest releases as well as a photo and a short bio from their wikipedia page.
So that I can quickly and easily see more about the artist I am interested in.
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am searching for an artist to get their latest releases and a short bio with a picture.
WHEN I search for an artist
THEN I see the latest releases 
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with a short bio and a photo of the artist
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN my searches persist
```

## Usage

To use the app enter an artist's name and hit the search button.  You will be presented with a bio of the artist along with their photo and top releases.
